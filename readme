This project estimates the fair value of Employee Stock Options (ESOs) using a Monte Carlo simulation framework and validates results with the Blackâ€“Scholes model. It demonstrates practical application of stochastic modeling, market data integration, and IFRS-aligned fair value reporting.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, yFinance

Methods: Monte Carlo Simulation, Blackâ€“Scholes Valuation, Volatility Estimation

ðŸ“Š Process

Data Collection

Downloaded Nokia stock data (2018â€“2024) via yfinance.

Computed daily log returns and estimated annualized volatility.

Monte Carlo Simulation

Simulated 1,000 price paths using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM).

Calculated ESO discounted payoffs over a 4-year maturity.

Blackâ€“Scholes Benchmark

Implemented the closed-form formula for European call options.

Compared results with Monte Carlo output for validation.

Visualization & Export

Plotted:

Distribution of discounted option payoffs (Monte Carlo)

Histogram of daily log returns

Exported results into CSV for auditability and reproducibility.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Results
Model	Value (per option, EUR)
Monte Carlo	1.0092
Blackâ€“Scholes	1.1649

Volatility is the main driver of ESO value.

Monte Carlo and Blackâ€“Scholes produced consistent valuations, increasing confidence in results.

Payoff distribution shows high probability of zero payoff but potential upside.
